Code is ready for maven central

1) version in pom.xml should not contain -SNAPSHOT

2) mvn clean deploy

this stages to sonatype and releases to public (publish).

3) Should get 2 emails from the repository - one about staging, the other about promotion

The build should be in maven central in 10 min.

Detailed instructions here:

That's it.
